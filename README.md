# HERMES

**Overview**


HERMES (High Entropy Repository for Materials Exploration and Screening) is a cutting-edge machine learning (ML) model designed to predict the formation energies of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs). HEAs are a class of materials with promising mechanical and thermal properties, which makes them ideal candidates for various engineering applications. However, the exploration of new HEA compositions and their associated formation energies remains a complex and computationally expensive process.

This repository houses a predictive model trained on a vast set of material data, which accelerates the discovery of novel HEAs by providing accurate predictions for their formation energies. HERMES serves as a tool for materials scientists and engineers to explore new alloys without the need for extensive experimental work or time-consuming simulations.

**Key Features**


**Machine Learning Model**: A robust ML model for the accurate prediction of formation energies of HEAs.

**High Entropy Alloy Screening**: Enables rapid screening of HEA compositions for potential candidates with desired properties.

**Data-Driven Approach**: Trained on a large dataset of known HEAs, the model uses correlations between composition and formation energy to make predictions.

**Open-Source**: Open access to the model and scripts for use, modification, and contribution.
